# Week 1.3—Create

## look ahead to Week 3 (15:00 to 15:05)

- announce syllabus updates
- point out readings for Monday

## introduce *Introductory Web Page* assignment (15:05 to 15:10)

- emphasize the scope of this assignment
  - this is not an HTML and CSS class
  - technically speaking, you don't need to know HTML and CSS to work with Course Management Systems
  - it's still tremendously helpful, so I hope you'll try to pick some up throughout the class
  - today's class (and this weekend's assignment) is more about making sure you're familiar with the basics
  - it's also about learning how to search for resources so that if you don't know how to do something in HTML or CSS, you can know how to find it
  - another thing to learn from this is to get our heads around the idea that everything we see on the Internet is a file
    - you are making a web page for this assignment, and that means creating a file; your web page will include an image, which will involve referencing another file
    - a modern web page has huge amounts of content distributed among a whole bunch of files, which is one of the reasons that we need content management systems; however, we can appreciate that a little bit better if we just remind ourselves that even a simple web page is made up of one or two files

- note that you can compare your code to your file in two ways:
  - if you're using a text editor, you can just open the file in your web browser
  - if you're working through GitHub, use [https://htmlpreview.github.io/](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) to check what your page will look like

## walkthrough for *Introductory Web Page* assignment (15:10 to 15:30)

- if you are hosting an image or other file on GitHub and want to download or embed it, copy the file name and paste `?raw=true` afterward
  - this is going to be really helpful if, say, you're hosting an image file in GitHub that you want to use for your website

- review of Markdown
  - what is a markup language?
  - what are some of the things that we can do with Markdown?

- compare this to HTML
  - HTML is also a markup language
  - it offers many more options and much more customization
  - show how we can do specific things in HTML that we could do in Markdown
  - emphasize tag structure: opening tag and closing tag, with a forward slash in the closing tag
  - *elements*, *attributes*, *values*, and *element content*

 - discuss CSS
  - HTML was never supposed to actually style content; it was just supposed to describe content so that it could be styled later
    - tags like `<strong></strong>` and `<em></em>` are part of HTML, but don't really fit with it
    - CSS was developed as a way of separating those two functions
  - in theory, CSS happens at the website level; a WordPress theme has a particular CSS setup which influences the entire website because it tells the site how things are supposed to look
  - in practice, it's really helpful to be able to do some CSS on the fly
  - any Web browser or other software that can parse HTML makes basic assumption about what elements should look like
   - sometimes we want to change that
   - a few ways to do CSS
     - in a separate file (we'll run into this with WordPress, but we're not tackling this now)
     - in a <style></style> element in HTML (open CV)
     - in-line CSS

## work on *Introductory Web Page* assignment (15:30 to 15:50)

- just start Googling—how do you do X with HTML or CSS
- feel free to ask me questions, too!
- these don't have to be masterpieces, I just want you to have some hands on experience with this
