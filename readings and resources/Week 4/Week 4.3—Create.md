# Week 4.3—Create

- request pictures of board from last Friday

## review roles in a content management team (15:00 to 15:05)

- prompt for different roles:
  - editor
  - site planners
  - developers
  - administrators
  - stakeholders
- prompt for what each of these roles does

## meet by roles (15:05 to 15:25)

 - gather by the primary role that you're interested in
    - normally, these would be hats, not people, but in a class this big, chances are that you'll work with one particular group
 - spend ~15 minutes:
    - discussing what your group's responsibilities will be for putting together the CMS Guidebook
    - organizing workflows within your group to make sure those responsibilities are accounted for
      - may want to create one or more Slack channels for your group
      - figure out how ClickUp could be useful for your group
    - taking notes of your discussion (and sending them to me) so that you have a record of your discussions so far!
      - best way to do this is to have someone create a new Markdown document in their forked version of the class repository and then add it through a pull request
    - nominating one person to be a spokesperson for a class discussion

> note that nothing that you decide on today is necessarily permanent—it's important to have a rough plan in place so that you can improve it later

## discuss as a class (15:25 to 15:40)

- have each spokesperson give a summary of the responsibilities and workflows their group came up with
  - everyone needs to pay attention so that we can keep a close eye out for possible gaps
- discuss inter-group workflows
  - how are we going to stay in touch with each other and make sure that this work is getting done?

## talk about Hugo (15:40 to 15:50)

- review Hugo activity from Wednesday
- explain that next Friday, we'll start laying this out to give our guidebook some structure
- start thinking about how to make the website structure fit the guidebook structure that we have in mind
