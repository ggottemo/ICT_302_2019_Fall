# Week 5.2—Explore

## introduction (15:00 to 15:03)

- TPS content vs. presentation

## introduce themes (15:03 to 15:05)

- we've been talking about these presentation files as though it's up to the content management team to develop them
- that may be the case, but many CMS systems have a robust ecology of "themes" that govern most of this
- in fact, the presentation templates that we looked at on Monday are all contained within a "theme" folder in the Hugo repository
- today, we're going to be exploring these presentation files by looking at some Hugo themes, including the one for our class website

## look at theme files (15:05 to 15:22)

- spend about ten minutes going through the theme files in our GitHub repository (there's a link in the syllabus)
- try to figure out what different files do
  - look for templates in particular, and note what different templates correspond to
  - also consider other things that you could change by modifying the theme
- right now, we're not making any changes—just making a mental list of things that you could change if you wanted to
- there are a ton of template files here, many of which overlap with each other, so get into the nitty-gritty details here

## theme files report back (15:22 to 15:25)

- what did you figure out how to change? how would you do that?
- anything goes!

## introduce looking at other themes (15:25 - 15:28)

- introduce Hugo theme directory
- go through the themes, and find some that you like
  - if a theme stands out to you, look at the **Demo**
  - if a theme really stands out to you, look at the **homepage**, where the code is kept; see if you can find the template(s) or other files that produce the effect that you like
- after ~10 minutes, you'll show someone else in the class

## look at other themes (15:28 - 15:35)

## theme report (15:35-15:40)

- walk through what you discovered with a friend

## hack our Hugo (15:40 to 15:50)
