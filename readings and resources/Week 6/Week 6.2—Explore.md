# Week 6.2—Explore

## get WordPress set up (15:00 to 15:10)

- everyone should have received an invitation to our class WordPress by now
- log in, give yourself a nickname, reset your password, and take care of everything else

## discuss WordPress user permissions (15:10 to 15:25)

- bring up default WP user permissions
  - based on the responsibilities for each of your groups, what role or roles would you expect people in your group to have?
  - explain that WP administrator privileges are simply off limits—ask if anyone can guess why?
- show a screenshot of `Capability Manager Enhanced` menu
  - in your groups, come up with some roles and subroles that might exist in your groups
  - discuss the permissions that each of those roles and subroles should have
- spend time discussing permissions and creating those roles together
- ask people to disable their visual editor and explain why

## tinkering with WordPress (15:25 to 15:35)

- have groups list potential tasks that they need to get done within the WordPress interface (as informed by their roles/groups)
- give students time to explore the WordPress interface and see what they're capable of doing: both things they suggested and other things they happened to figure out
- discuss what people figured out how to do
- discuss whether permissions are set properly, etc.

## compare WordPress with Hugo (15:35 to 15:42)
- ask for perceived differences between WP and Hugo
- emphasize that WP is much more complicated than Hugo
  - w/Hugo, we work with the files directly
  - w/WP, there's a lot more going on, so that doesn't make sense
    - there **are** files under the hood, but working with them directly is much more complicated
    - so, we work with the interface instead

## look at WordPress post screen (15:42 to 15:50)
- discuss Gutenberg editor, explain why we aren't going to use it
  - specific to WordPress (more time we spend on Gutenberg, less time we spend on general principles)
  - Gutenberg takes away our opportunities to work as close to the code as possible
  - compare Gutenberg view to code editor, note how Gutenberg stuff is represented in code editor
