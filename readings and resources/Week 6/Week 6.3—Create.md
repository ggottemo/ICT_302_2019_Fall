# Week 6.3—Explore

## confirm WordPress roles (15:00 to 15:10)

- explain process of making some custom roles with finer-grained permissions
- have everyone sign in and make sure that they've been given the correct role
  - all Editors have now been bumped down to Contributors; this is to kickstart conversations about how y'all are going to arrange yourselves
- explain that if they haven't, they should talk to administrators
- explain that if we need to tweak permissions, they should talk to me

## introduce workshop time (15:10 to 15:15)

- now that we're finally working with WordPress, it's time to really get the ball rolling with this project
- we're just before the mid-semester point, so we have 9 or 10 weeks to come up with a Guidebook
- this should be taking a bunch of our time
- the reason that I haven't assigned a bunch of readings or assessments in this class is because putting together a decent CMS Guidebook should take the amount of work that those readings or assessments will; you are all essentially giving yourselves the homework
  - I don't want you to stress out about that, but I do want you to take it seriously
- so, everyone in this class needs to leave today with at least one thing assigned to them, recorded somewhere (preferably ClickUp, which I've just cleaned out) that will ensure some accountability; if there's someone that you know isn't in class, go ahead and assign them something reasonable (this happens in the workplace all the time, and they'll have a chance to let you or me know if someone's out of line)
- along with that discussion, you should come up with some reasonable deadlines for those assignments
- if you get your assignments made within the first fifteen minutes of your discussion, that doesn't mean the rest of the class is free time—it means that you now have some workshop time to get started with all of this
- if you get your job done by the end of class, that should be a good opportunity to talk to folks about another assignment
- if you don't have your job done by the end of class, now you have some homework and a due date for it

## review Mid-Semester Written Agreement (15:15 to 15:17)

- keep in mind that by October 20th, you're going to commit to some large scale contributions to this project and to being accountable to a particular classmate for those contributions; be thinking about this as we continue to tinker over the next few weeks

## conversation starters (15:17-15:20)

- I'm going to give you some broad starting points to think about for your discussions today, but a lot of this is up to you; I'll circle around and make sure I'm checking in with people, too:

  - Administrators:
    - view from 10,000 feet and rough project calendar
    - this is going to involve talking to other people to figure out what they're up to and what you all need to do to coordinate it

  - Site Designers and Developers:
    - might be good to work together today to decide on a division of labor; there are a few things that will involve both of you:
      - how are we going to handle WP to PDF at the end of the semester?
      - what do we want the website to look like?
        - themes?
        - CSS?
      - also menus

  - Editors
    - last Friday, you came up with a potential layout for the book
    - figure out how you want to organize that within WordPress
    - part of this is posts vs. pages
    - also, how fine-grained do you want to get: we saw yesterday that it's next to impossible for two people to work on the same post/page at the same time, so should every chapter get a whole page? or do you want to split things up and use something like categories

you are probably all going to need to talk to each other to get your work done; don't wait for me to tell you that to reach out to someone
