# Week 7.2â€”Explore

## review self-directed learning part of class (15:00 to 15:05)

- [link to xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com/627/)
- focus in on "Google the name of the program plus a few words"
- this is good, but having some more specific resources to go to is even better!
- WordPress is so popular that there is stuff all over the Internet that can help you out if you get into a pinch
- however, it's helpful to know some of the big websites and to test them out to see how you feel about them

## TPS some questions (15:05 to 15:07)
- think about the work you've done with WordPress already and the work that you're going to need to do during the semester
- come up with one question (as specific as possible) that you have about WordPress so far, the answer to which you'll need to continue your work
- take a minute on your own and think about your question
- share your question with someone sitting next to you and see if talking through it makes your question any more clear

## introduce activity (15:07 to 15:10)
- on the syllabus for today, I have listed four categories of resources, each of which has at least two separate resources in it
- I am going to count you off 1-4, and you are then going to spend 5-7 minutes looking over the resources in that category.
- As you look over those resources, focus on these five questions:
  - what are these resources?
  - how do the resources work?
  - what are the strengths and weaknesses of these resources?
  - what might you use these resources for?
  - (how) could you answer your question with these resources?
- make sure to take these questions seriously, because then we're going to have three rounds where you teach those resources to your classmates; each time, you're going to have 5-7 minutes to explain your category to someone who hasn't learned about that category yet; we'll then repeat until everyone has learned about all four categories

## round 1 (15:10 to 15:17)
## round 2 (15:17 to 15:24)
## round 3 (15:24 to 15:31)
## round 4 (15:31 to 15:38)

## class discussion (15:38 to 15:50)

- go over each resource and answer questions together
