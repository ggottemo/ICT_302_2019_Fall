# Week 7.3—Create

## talk about moving between groups (15:00 to 15:05)

- editors should be able to conscript others
- other people should volunteer to be editors—remember that as you do your work, you're going to learn things about the CMS process that you probably want to go into the CMS Guidebook and that the editors might not be thinking about
- whenever you learn a lesson that you think you want to remember, go to the editors and volunteer to write something up for them; don't worry about making it perfect, because that's their job
- this is especially helpful if you feel like you're scrambling for something to do

## review Mid-Semester Written Agreement (15:05 to 15:20)

- remember that everyone should leave with an assignment!

- repeat questions for each group
  - what have you been doing to work toward the CMS Guidebook?
  - what you will be doing to work toward the CMS Guidebook?
  - what obstacles are you running into to work on the CMS Guidebook?
    - do you have any requests for other groups?

## workshop time (15:15-15:50)
